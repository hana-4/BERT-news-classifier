# BERT from scratch for News Classification

This project is a category based news filtering system that leverages the **BERT model built from scratch**, pretrained on **WikiText-103**, and **fine-tuned on AG News** dataset. The app is powered by **Streamlit** and uses **NewsAPI** to fetch the latest headlines. It classifies the news articles and displays items from the category selected by the user.

## Model Pipeline

1. **Pretraining**: Masked Language Modeling and Next Sentence Prediction on WikiText-103 dataset. 
2. **Fine-tuning**: Classification on AG News dataset.
3. **Prediction**: Top headlines fetched using NewsAPI are classified, and only those matching the userâ€™s category input are displayed.
